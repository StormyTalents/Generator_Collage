<h3>Collage Generator uses machine learning techniques, such as K-Means Clustering, to determine which images should be used to draw the message and which to use as the background.</h3>

<p>Given a single set of images (.zip file) and a message to display, my Collage Generator returns a high resolution collage with the message drawn out using the images. It works by determining a subset of images that are the most distinct and drawing the message with those and the background with the others.</p>
